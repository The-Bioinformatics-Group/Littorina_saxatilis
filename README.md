# _Littorina saxatilis_

Bioinformatic analyses on the evolution of reproductive isolation between locally adapted populations of the rough periwinkle.

The content of this repository includes research projects that aim to understand the evolution of barriers to gene exchange using a formidable model system, the rocky-shore snail _Littorina saxatilis_.

* LGid_r2_approach  
Can we map variants with unknown position on the linkage map using infomation about linkage disequilibrium with known variants?

* short_genetic_variants  
Can short insertions and deletions (INDELs $\leq$ 50 bp) be reliable genetic markers for the investigation of local adaptation and ecological speciation?
