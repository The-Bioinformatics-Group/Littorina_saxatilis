# Background

1. Mutations are changes in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA and their size can range from one base to (size of the longest variant). As their size increases, their contribution to genetic diversity also increases as well as their deleterious effect on the fitness of the individual carrying the mutation. (many SNPs down to few large inversions). (consequences of selection on the variants linked to the target of selection). Therefore, detecting mutations and calculating nucleotide diversity can reveal past demographic and evolutionary events that have shaped the DNA sequence at both population and species level.  
Originally, mutations were detected using (first method of variant calling) and now, after the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, it is possible to scan whole genomes in search for different types of mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been primary targets of genetic and genomic analyses that aimed to (applications for SNPs). Few studies have looked at other types of genetic variants in the past but a growing attention has been currently placed on structural variants (SVs). This shift from the detection of small to large mutation can be mainly associated with the development of NGS methods such as (sequence of longer reads). The notion about the importance of SVs is not new in the field of evolutionary genetics but our knowledge about their role of SVs is still limited to a few model species.

2. Short INDELs and their applications [@chen2009].

3. Low number of studies has used INDELs because of the challenges associated with INDEL discovery [@narzisiandschatz2015].

4. INDELs can show a different and complementary evolutionary pattern compared to the one based on SNPs.

5. SNP-based study in _Littorina saxatilis_, species biology and results.

# Question  
Can short INDELs be used as genetic markers for patterns of local adaptation?

# Hypothesis  
Nucleotide divergence between closely related species can be composed of a higher percentage of short INDELs than SNPs [@britten2002] and the same pattern might be found between two locally adapted populations of the same species. Detecting INDELs can reveal additional evolutionary processes that would otherwise be unnoticed by a SNP-based analysis.
